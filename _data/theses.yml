    title: Rewarding System in Blockchain-Based Proximity Advertising Platforms
    location: University of Insubria, Varese, Italy
    summary: >
        I supervised a Master student to extend ProMark, my blockchain-based proximity advertising platform. The student is required to design a reward system for ProMark to provide rewards to customers according to their contributions to proximity advertising campaigns. The design relies on homomorphic commitments (Pedersen Commitment), zero-knowledge-proof, multi-party computation. The implementation has been implemented in Hyperledger Fabric.

    skills:
      - Hyperledger Fabric
      - Go
      - Node.js
      - Zero-Knowledge-Proof
      - Homomorphic Commitment
      - Cryptography

    title: Blockchain-Based Anonymization
    location: University of Insubria, Varese, Italy
    summary: >
        I supervised a Master student to design a blockchain platform to ensure the transaprency of data owners, data providers, and data recipients. The system allows data owners to provide their anonymity levels, the providers to share anonymized knowledge graphs to data recipients, and the data owners to verify whether the anonymized knowledge graphs satisfying their provided anonymity levels. The design relies on Hyperledger Fabric, homomorphic encryption (Elgama Scheme), zero-knowledge-proof.
    skills:
      - Hyperledger Fabric
      - Go
      - Node.js
      - Zero-Knowledge-Proof
      - Homomorphic Encryption
      - Cryptography
