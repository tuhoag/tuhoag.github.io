description: I am a senior researcher in designing privacy-preserving and security technologies. My main research projects introduce privacy-preserving technologies for publishing data (i.e., knowledge graphs, relational data, textual data) and decentralized systems (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform created by IBM). Moreover, I am a reviewer of high-quality journals and conferences (e.g., VLDB, TOPS).
