description: I am a senior researcher in privacy and security. My main research projects include designing privacy-preserving technologies for publishing data (i.e., knowledge graphs, relational data, textual data) and decentralized systems (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric, a permissioned blockchain platform created by IBM). Moreover, I have reviewed many research articles from high-quality journal and conferences (e.g., VLDB, TOPS).
