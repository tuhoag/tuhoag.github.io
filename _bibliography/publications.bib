  abstract  = {The application of fingerprinting techniques to relational data cannot protect personal information against a collusion attack, in which the attacker has access to a set of published data. The general fingerprinting techniques such as Li et at.'s, Guo et al.'s, and Schrittwieser et al.'s focus on detecting the traitor, who leaked the data. Among them, Schrittwieser et al.'s fingerprinting technique combines {\$}{\$}k{\$}{\$}-anonymity and full-domain generalization in order to not only detect traitors but also protect personal records. However, the technique has two main limitations. First, it does not allow the data provider to insert or delete records from the original data. Secondly, it does not create enough fingerprints for data recipients. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, we propose an ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha ,k{\$}{\$})-privacy protection model, an extension of {\$}{\$}m{\$}{\$}-invariance and ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha , k{\$}{\$})-anonymity, and a new top-down ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha , k{\$}{\$})-privacy fingerprinting algorithm based on that model. The model not only protects sensitive personal information against collusion attacks but also allows data providers to republish their updated original data without degrading the privacy protection. The algorithm embeds fingerprints in the generalized data and extracts them from leaked data to detect the traitors. We extensively evaluate the proposed algorithm on our own built software. The evaluation results show that our algorithm creates more fingerprints than Schrittwieser et al.'s algorithm (64000 vs 1536) while achieving the same generalized data quality. Moreover, our ({\$}{\$}{\backslash}alpha , k{\$}{\$})-privacy algorithm creates generalized data even in the case of having small number of distinct sensitive values in the original data without adding faked records as in {\$}{\$}m{\$}{\$}-invariance.},

  abstract  = {While knowledge graphs (KGs) are getting popular as they can formalize many types of users' data in social networks, sharing these data may reveal users' identities. Although many protection models have been presented to protect users in anonymized data, they are unsuitable to protect the users in KGs. To cope with this problem, we propose k-AttributeDegree (k-ad), a model to protect users' identities in anonymized KGs. We further present information loss metrics tailored to KGs and a cluster-based anonymization algorithm to generate anonymized KGs satisfying k-ad. Finally, we conduct experiments on five real-life data sets to evaluate our algorithm and compare it with previous work.},

  abstract  = {Time-related information in text posted on-line is one type of personal information targeted by attackers, one reason that sharing information online can be risky. Therefore, time information should be anonymized before it is posted on social networking services. One approach to anonymizing information is to replace sensitive phrases with anonymous phrases, but attackers can usually spot such anonymization due to its unnaturalness. Another approach is to detect temporal passages in the text, but removal of these passages can make the meaning of the text unnatural. We have developed an algorithm that can be used to anonymize time-related personal information by removing the temporal passages when doing so will not change the natural meaning of the message. The temporal phrases are detected by using machine-learned patterns, which are represented by a subtree of the sentence parsing tree. The temporal phrases in the parsing tree are distinguished from other parts of the tree by using temporal taggers integrated into the algorithm. In an experiment with 4008 sentences posted on a social network, 84.53 {\%} of them were anonymized without changing their intended meaning. This is significantly better than the 72.88 {\%} rate of the best previous temporal phrase detection algorithm. Of the learned patterns, the top ten most common ones were used to detect 87.78 {\%} the temporal phrases. This means that only some of the most common patterns can be used to the anonymize temporal phrases in most messages to be posted on an SNS. The algorithm works well not only for temporal phrases in text posted on social networks but also for other types of phrases (such as location and objective ones), other areas (religion, politics, military, etc.), and other languages.},
