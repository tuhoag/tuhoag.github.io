description: I am a senior researcher in privacy, security, machine learning, and decentralized systems. I have presented privacy-preserving technologies for machine learning/deep learning on various data types (i.e., knowledge graphs, relational data, textual data) and decentralized systems (i.e., Hyperledger Fabric). The techniques require me to have strong knowledge of state-of-the-art machine learning/deep learning models to analyze their vulnerabilities and protect them. Moreover, I am a reviewer of high-quality journals and conferences (e.g., VLDB, TOPS).
